### Brain tumor segmentation in MRI with multi-modality spatial information enhancement and boundary shape correction

-----------
Highlights

• Proposes a novel CNN-based brain tumor segmentation method.

• Introduces an MIE module to utilize the multi-modality information better.

• Designs an SIE module to preserve the spatial information better.

• Presents a BSC module to improve the segmentation accuracy of boundaries.

• Achieves the state-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation results.

#### DataSets

----------

The dataset used in this paper is BraTS2018，2019 and 2020. The datasets can be found in kaggle, using the training set part.
